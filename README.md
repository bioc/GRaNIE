This project is currently under active development. 


Repository structure
----------------------
This repository for our *GRaNIE* package (**G**ene **R**egul**a**tory **N**etwork **I**nference including **E**nhancers) 


The full documentation for the all packages is available at the following stable URL and will soon be extended and completed:

**[https://grp-zaugg.embl-community.io/GRaNIE](https://grp-zaugg.embl-community.io/GRaNIE)**


**We are soon submitting our *GRaNIE* and the associated *GRaNIEData* for being included on *Bioconductor*. Once we are accepted and the package is included in the stable release of *Bioconductor*, we will update the installation guidelines in the documentation.**



**If you use our packages, please use the following citation (we will update it once the paper has been officially published):**
